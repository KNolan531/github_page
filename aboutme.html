Originally from Conyers, GA and graduating from Rockdale County High school, I am now a long-time resident in the Vinings community of Atlanta.</P>  

<p class="auto-style4" align = "justify">I have always had an interest in computers since I was young due to my father being in the IT field. He would constantly bring home computers and set them up so I could always play around with them and got to experience “Ms-Dos”  and floppy disks at a young age! As I got older I got more interested in how the software operated and how webpages were designed which led me to a more software based program. </p>

<p class="auto-style4" align = "justify">Outside of school, I like to go hiking and explore different historic trails and parks in Georgia. I am also big into fitness and regularly lift weights and various cardio activities 3-5 days to help stay in shape.  I am a huge Atlanta Braves, Falcons and UGA Bulldog fan and in the fall am glued to football on weekends. Recently I have taken an interest in learning guitar and take weekly lessons with both acoustic and electric guitar!
