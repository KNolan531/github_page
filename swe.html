    <p class="ptext"> This section will highlight various course assignments and projects from my software engineering courses I have taken at Kennesaw State. 
        They range from a full semester project involving the whole SDLC, user centered design prototypes, requirements and architecture documentation. <BR><BR>
        Each section below has a short description and corresponding button. In the future this page will be implemented as a drop-down box on the navbar.   </p>

                 <p /> <center>
                This was a project completed for SWE 3313 - Intro to Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University. The project involved going through the entire SDLC and ended with a digital prototype.<p />
                A software design plan, requirements document, paper prototype and test cases were all created and included on this page. The final prototype with limited features was created using Visual Studio and implemented via C#. Application executable is available upon request.

                <p /> <center> This is a project I completed for course SWE 4324 - User Centered Design at Kennesaw State University. This project involved teaming up with another student (the user) and using an iterative process to gather requirements and functionality for a mobile app for a robot. 
                    <p /> Marvel Prototyping system was used to create a final prototype and is provided. Various research, requirements, use cases, and test case documentation are provided as well.

                <p /> <center> This section provides documentation,models and diagrams that were created during course SWE 3623 - Software Architecture at Kennesaw State. 
                    The class gave an indepth look at the various software modeling and design techniques 
                    <p /> Diagrams are provided that consist of state, E-R, UML and class diagrams. There are also Use Case and flow charts included as well.
