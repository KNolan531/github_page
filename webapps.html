    <p class="ptext"> This section will highlight various web apps that I have primarily created using javascript with the usage of frameworks/packages like jquery, embedded js and express.
        <BR> In addition, there are also a few react apps as well. All apps use nodejs as their server and are published to the web via usage of services like heroku, vercel and github. 
            <BR> <BR>All links are external to the web app itself so you must use your back button to return here when done. Github repositories are provided for some of these apps as well.

                <h1 class="boxHeading"><u><strong>Kool Notes App (React)</strong></u> </h1>
                 <p  align="left"> This is a webapp created using React that simulates the Google Keeper app. It is basically a note card system in which the user can 
                   create a note card and input a title and then the note contents itself. When the user clicks the "+" button then the card is added below and the original note card clears 
                   for them to create another new one to add.</p> <p align="left"  />The notes line up adjacently similar to a note board concept and can be deleted. This is a basic "front-end" version that clears on page reload
                   and will be updated soon in the future with database/backend capability to save the notes.  

                   <p align="left"/> This project was created using React and styled using both CSS and material UI react features. 
                   The project was created using different components to be rendered: one for the Note card itself, one for the top submit form, and then one for the header/footer. <p  align="left"/>The usage 
                   of Hooks and UseState were implemented to handle the user input in the App component with usage of the Map array function to continuously add more notes. 
                   Finally the usage of 2 functions: add and delete in the App component to handle updating the content at run time.

                <p align="left"/> This is a webapp project I completed with a team for SWE App Domain course at Kennesaw State University. 
                This was a semester long project in which we learned concepts relating to a specific domain (Accounting in this case) and then implemented them in different 
                Sprints. Each sprint had it's own requirements that added new features and components to the app. 
                    <p align="left"/>The Accounting app itself was expected to simulate a real life accounting firm with user types of Admin, Manager and Accountant. 
                    Each user type had access to differnet features that consisted of Creating and Modifying financial accounts, creating journal entries and adjusting financial records. 
                    <p align="left"/> React was chosen as the frontend for this system as it had a User Log-In template/component already easily available and not difficult to work with. 
                    Firebase was used to create an online database for the different user accounts using their FireStore system and using API calls to access the data. 
                    <p align="left"/> An external link is provided below, a test email (ashiv@gmail.com) and password(testingpass123) can be used to access the system and explore the different features. <center>

                <p align ="left"/>  This was a side project I created while taking a course on Embedded Javascript(EJS). It is basically a blog website that lists various blog posts and the user can 
                click on each post to read more and be directed to a new page displaying the whole post. The admin also has access to a Compose Post form to create a new blog post. 
                    <p align="left" /> This site is implemented using NodeJS, along with template views rendered using Embedded Javascript(EJS) to manipulate the user interface. 
                    Different ejs files are created and stored as "views" and directed to when a link is clicked on. A database connection to MongoDB using the Mongoose package is used 
                    to save the blog posts so they will always appear on reload.

                            The class gave an indepth look at the various software modeling and design techniques 
                            <p /> Diagrams are provided that consist of state, E-R, UML and class diagrams. There are also Use Case and flow charts included as well.
